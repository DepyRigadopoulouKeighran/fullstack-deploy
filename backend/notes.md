# Full-Stack review 


# Local Service Marketplace Backend Structure


## Simplified Database Schema


### Users
- `username`
- `email`
- `password`  hash the password before saving in data base
- `location` (String format, e.g., city or ZIP code)
- `profilePicture` (Optional URL to an image)
- `services` array of services
### Services
- `userID` (Foreign Key, references Users)
- `title`
- `description`
- `category` (E.g., Tutoring, Plumbing, Gardening)
- `price` (Fixed or hourly rate as a simple string or number)
- `location` (To match user's location format, for filtering services by location)


## Simplified RESTful API Endpoints


### User Authentication
- `POST /auth/register`: Register a new user.
- `POST /auth/login`: Authenticate a user.
### User Profiles
- `GET /users/:userID`: Retrieve a user profile by ID.
- `PUT /users/:userID`: Update a user profile.
- `DELETE /users/:userID`: Delete a user profile.
### Services
- `POST /services`: Allow a user to create a new service listing.
- `GET /services`: Retrieve all services. Include query parameters to support filtering by category and location.
- `GET /services/:serviceID`: Retrieve details of a specific service.
- `PUT /services/:serviceID`: Update a service listing.
- `DELETE /services/:serviceID`: Remove a service listing.

## Additional Considerations


### Security and Authentication
- Protect routes accordingly. Ensure users can only update or delete their profiles or services.
- Use JWT for managing user sessions and authentication.

### Handling User Input

- Implement validation for user inputs both on the frontend and backend to maintain data integrity and prevent security vulnerabilities.

### File and Image Uploads
- If including profile or service images, consider integrating with a cloud storage solution. You might use middleware for handling uploads in Express, like `multer` for multipart/form-data.


### Search and Filtering
- For `GET /services`, implement functionality to filter results based on user-provided criteria like location or category. This might involve simple string matching or more advanced querying depending on your database choice.
